# card-matching-game v1.0.0

card-matching-game is a very basic game that majority of us would have alredy played.

In this project, I will be using only `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`, without the usage of any external UI and/or State-Management framework / library like `React`, `Vue`, `Angular`, etc. , as a challenge.

## Basic Structure of the project :

- The HTML file contains only the basic skeliton of the UI
- external css-stylesheets contains the main styling / positioning.
- the Cards will be injected in the HTML by `data.js`, as soon as the page gets loaded.
- the interaction logic of Cards, including click events, is written in `app.js`
- The file `styler.js` contains some optional styling and animation functions that makes the game more engaging.
